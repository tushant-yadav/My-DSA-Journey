/*
umber of 1 Bits
Difficulty: EasyAccuracy: 76.5%Submissions: 136K+Points: 2
Given a positive integer N, print count of set bits in it. 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 6
Output:
2
Explanation:
Binary representation is '110' 
So the count of the set bit is 2.
Example 2:

Input:
8
Output:
1
Explanation:
Binary representation is '1000' 
So the count of the set bit is 1.
Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function setBits() which takes an Integer N and returns the count of number of set bits.

Expected Time Complexity: O(LogN)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 109
